# Introduction

Hello, Hello, Hi!

I am learning JavaScript using the freeCodeCamp's <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8" target="_blank">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures</a> course. While learning, this was the **Second Project** of building a basic *Calorie Counter*. I tweaked some of the elements of it, and I have plans to add more features in future as I learn more.

# Features

- Multiple entry options for every entry module.
- Clear button
- Workout input option
- Clear button
- **Deficit or Surplus Calculation** (*main feature*)
